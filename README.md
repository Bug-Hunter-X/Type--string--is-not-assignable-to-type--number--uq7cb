This bug demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript. The function `combine` is designed to take two arrays of numbers as input and return a new array containing all elements from both input arrays.  However, the second input array `arr2` contains a string element ("hello"), which violates the function's type signature.  This leads to a type error because TypeScript correctly identifies that a string cannot be assigned to a number type. The solution involves ensuring type consistency.
